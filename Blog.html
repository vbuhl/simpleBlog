                    A chronicle of country music legend Johnny Cash's life,
                    from his early days on an Arkansas cotton farm to his rise to fame with Sun Records in Memphis,
                    where he recorded alongside Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins.

                    A woman's love, given reluctantly, saves a man from addiction and self-destruction. Traces 
                    the life of Johnny Cash from his boyhood, with the loss of a brother and the loss of his father's 
                    affection, to 1968 when his outlaw side and his unhappiness give way to the twin triumphs of his 
                    concert at Folsom Prison and June Carter's acceptance of his marriage proposal. Along the way 
                    there's his first composition, first recording, first marriage, daughters, being smitten with 
                    June, divorce, pills and booze, an empty life, and the Carter family's nursing him back to 
                    health. June eases Johnny out of a ring of fire.

                    A confined but troubled rock star descends into madness
                    in the midst of his physical and social isolation from everyone.

                    The movie tells the story of rock singer "Pink" who is sitting in his 
                    hotel room in Los Angeles, burnt out from the music business and only able 
                    to perform on stage with the help of drugs. Based on the 1979 double album 
                    "The Wall" by Pink Floyd, the film begins in Pink's youth where he is crushed 
                    by the love of his mother. Several years later, he is punished by the teachers 
                    in school because he is starting to write poems. He slowly begins to build a wall 
                    around himself to be protected from the world outside. The film shows all this in 
                    massive and epic pictures until the very end where he tears down the wall and breaks free.

                    Two South Africans set out to discover what happened to their unlikely musical hero, 
                    the mysterious 1970s rock 'n' roller, Rodriguez.

                    In the early 1970s, Sixto Rodriguez was a Detroit folksinger who had a short-lived 
                    recording career with only two well received but non-selling albums. Unknown to Rodriguez, 
                    his musical story continued in South Africa where he became a pop music icon and inspiration 
                    for generations. Long rumored there to be dead by suicide, a few fans in the 1990s decided to 
                    seek out the truth of their hero's fate. What follows is a bizarrely heartening story in which 
                    they found far more in their quest than they ever hoped, while a Detroit construction laborer 
                    discovered that his lost artistic dreams came true after all.
